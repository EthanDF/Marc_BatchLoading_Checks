# Marc_BatchLoading_Checks
batchloading error checks for MARC records based on 

Traill, Stacie. "Quality issues in vendor-provided e-monograph records." Library Resources &amp; Technical Services Oct. 2013: 213+.

Runs a series of checks, mostly those defined as "F" by Stacie Traill in her cited paper.

Plan to add automated updates to the MARC file where possible. It would also be good to have some reporting tools, though so that we can track how many updates this file makes.
